The Greepobot uses the following Python packages/modules/wrappers etc:

Skype4PY
Cleverbot
BeautifulSoup


Skype should be running before you start the bot.  When you start the bot for the first time you will need to allow the script access to the skype client.
A dialog will appear in the gui and you select 'allow access'.

If you are missing any of the python modules it needs it will complain and you should be able to add what is missing.

The script will create a bot.cfg file in the current directory with a basic template for storing the Alliances/Players that users setup.  Find a way to back this file up often.

This script needs some good loving, error handling and more to stay alive. Until then, keep an eye on it.  It will crash when Grepolis data files are not available or weird things happen.
